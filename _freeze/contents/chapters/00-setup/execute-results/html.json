By the end of this chapter, you'll have **R**, **RStudio**, and **Quarto** installed and ready to go.\n\nIf you run into any difficulties with installation, see @sec-posit-cloud for a browser-based alternative that requires no installation.\n\n## Install R\n\nR is the programming language we'll use throughout this book. \n\nPlease go to the CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) website to download R: \n\n<https://cloud.r-project.org/>\n\n\\\n\n![Download R](../../images/install/cran-download-r.png){#fig-cran-download-r width=\"100%\"}\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n### Windows\n\n1. Click **\"Download R for Windows\"**\n2. Click **\"base\"**\n3. Click the download link for the latest version (e.g., \"Download R-4.x.x for Windows\")\n4. Run the installer with default settings\n\n![Download R for Windows](../../images/install/download-r-win.png){#fig-download-r-win width=\"80%\"}\n\n### macOS\n\n1. Click **\"Download R for macOS\"**\n2. Choose the correct installer for your Mac:\n   - **Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4):** download the `arm64` version\n   - **Intel Mac:** download the `x86_64` version\n3. Open the `.pkg` file and follow the installer\n\n![Download R for macOS](../../images/install/download-r-macos.png){#fig-download-r-macos width=\"60%\"}\n\n\n### Linux\n\n1. Click **\"Download R for Linux\"**\n2. Follow the instructions for your distribution (Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, etc.)\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Which version of R?\nAs of this writing, R 4.x is the current major version.\n:::\n\n## Install RStudio Desktop\n\nRStudio is an **integrated development environment (IDE)** for R --- it's where you'll write and run your R code. Take car analogy as en example: **R** is the *engine*, and **RStudio** is the *dashboard*.\n\nDownload RStudio Desktop (free) from:\n\n<https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>\n\n1. Go to the link above\n2. Download the **RStudio Desktop** installer for your operating system\n3. Run the installer with default settings\n4. Open RStudio --- it should automatically detect your R installation\n\n![RStudio download page](../../images/install/download-r-studio.png){#fig-download-r-studio width=\"60%\"}\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n## Install R first, then RStudio\nRStudio needs R to work. Always install R (the previous step) before installing RStudio.\n:::\n\n## Install Quarto CLI (Optional)\n\nQuarto is a publishing system that lets you create reports, documents, presentations, and websites from R code and text. We'll use Quarto in @sec-quarto to create reproducible reports.\n<!-- TODO: confirm @sec-quarto cross-ref label once Ch 9 is created -->\n\nDownload Quarto from:\n\n<https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/>\n\n1. Go to the link above\n2. Download the Quarto CLI installer for your operating system\n3. Run the installer with default settings\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Quarto may already be bundled with RStudio\nRecent versions of RStudio (2022.07+) include Quarto. You may already have it. To check, open a terminal and run:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\nquarto --version\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe still recommend installing the latest Quarto CLI separately to ensure you have the newest features.\n:::\n\n## Install Required R Packages\n\nR packages are **add-ons** that give R new abilities --- think of them as apps for your phone. We'll use several packages throughout this book.\n\nOpen RStudio and type the following in the **Console** pane (bottom-left):\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(c(\n  \"tidyverse\",        # dplyr, ggplot2, tidyr, readr, etc.\n  \"palmerpenguins\",   # penguins dataset\n  \"medicaldata\",      # scurvy dataset\n  \"skimr\",            # quick data summaries\n  \"gtsummary\",        # publication-ready summary tables\n  \"ellmer\"            # LLM from R (Ch 10)\n))\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## This may take a few minutes\nPackage installation downloads files from the internet and compiles code. Be patient --- this is a one-time process. You may see lots of messages scrolling by; that's normal.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n## Errors during installation?\nIf you see an error about a package not being available, check your internet connection and try again. If a specific package fails, you can skip it for now and install it later when the relevant chapter requires it.\n:::\n\n## Verify Your Installation\n\nLet's run a quick test to confirm everything is working. Create a new R script in RStudio (**File > New File > R Script**) and run the following code:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Test 1: R is working\nprint(\"Hello, R!\")\n\n# Test 2: Tidyverse loads successfully\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Test 3: A quick plot\nggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(title = \"Test Plot: Engine Size vs Highway MPG\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nIf you see `\"Hello, R!\"` printed in the Console and a scatter plot appear in the **Plots** pane, your setup is complete!\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## How to run code in RStudio\nPlace your cursor on a line of code and press **Cmd + Enter** (macOS) or **Ctrl + Enter** (Windows/Linux) to run it. You can also select multiple lines and run them all at once.\n:::\n\n## Posit Cloud (Online Alternative) {#sec-posit-cloud}\n\nIf you encounter installation difficulties or want to get started immediately without installing anything, you can use **Posit Cloud** --- a browser-based version of RStudio.\n\n1. Go to <https://posit.cloud/>\n2. Create a free account\n3. Click **\"New Project\"** > **\"New RStudio Project\"**\n4. You'll get a full RStudio environment in your browser\n\n<!-- ![Posit Cloud](../../images/screenshot-posit-cloud.png) -->\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nPosit Cloud is great for getting started quickly, but the free tier has limited computing hours per month. We recommend installing R and RStudio on your computer for long-term use.\n:::\n\n## Create an RStudio Project\n\nAn RStudio **Project** is a self-contained folder for your work. It automatically sets the working directory, so file paths like `\"data/diabetes.csv\"` just work without specifying the full path.\n\nFor this book's exercises, create a dedicated project:\n\n1. Open RStudio\n2. Go to **File > New Project...**\n3. Select **\"New Directory\"**\n4. Select **\"New Project\"**\n5. Enter a directory name (e.g., `r4medds-workshop`)\n6. Choose where to save it on your computer\n7. Click **\"Create Project\"**\n\n<!-- ![Create a new RStudio Project](../../images/screenshot-new-project.png) -->\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Why use RStudio Projects?\nProjects keep your files organized and set the **working directory** automatically. This means `read_csv(\"data/diabetes.csv\")` will find the file without needing the full path like `\"/Users/you/Documents/r4medds-workshop/data/diabetes.csv\"`.\n:::\n\n## A Quick Tour of RStudio\n\nWhen you open RStudio, you'll see four main panes:\n\n<!-- ![RStudio IDE layout](../../images/screenshot-rstudio-panes.png) -->\n\n```\n┌───────────────────────┬───────────────────────┐\n│                       │                       │\n│    Source Editor      │    Environment        │\n│    (write scripts)    │    (your variables)   │\n│                       │                       │\n├───────────────────────┼───────────────────────┤\n│                       │                       │\n│    Console            │    Files / Plots /    │\n│    (run commands)     │    Help / Viewer      │\n│                       │                       │\n└───────────────────────┴───────────────────────┘\n```\n\n- **Source Editor (top-left):** where you write and edit R scripts and Quarto documents. This is your main workspace.\n- **Console (bottom-left):** where R executes your code and displays output. You can type commands directly here, but writing them in the Source Editor is better for reproducibility.\n- **Environment (top-right):** shows your current variables and data frames. As you create objects in R, they appear here.\n- **Files / Plots / Help (bottom-right):** a multi-purpose pane. **Files** lets you browse your project folder. **Plots** displays your graphs. **Help** shows documentation when you use `?function_name`.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Customize your layout\nYou can rearrange these panes via **Tools > Global Options > Pane Layout**.\n:::\n\n## Summary\n\nYou now have a complete R development environment:\n\n- [x] **R** --- the programming language\n- [x] **RStudio** --- the IDE where you write and run code\n- [x] **Quarto** (Optional) --- the tool for creating reproducible reports\n- [x] **R packages** --- the add-ons we'll use throughout this book\n- [x] **RStudio Project** --- an organized workspace for your files\n\nYou're all set!
