RStudio is an **integrated development environment (IDE)** --- think of it as the cockpit where you'll write code, view results, manage files, and explore data, all in one place.\n\n## The Four Panes {#sec-rstudio-panes}\n\nWhen you first open RStudio, you'll see the interface divided into four main panes:\n\n![The RStudio IDE with four panes labeled](../../images/rstudio/rstudio-panes.png){#fig-rstudio-panes width=\"100%\"}\n\n```\n┌───────────────────────┬───────────────────────┐\n│                       │                       │\n│   1. Source Editor    │   2. Environment      │\n│      (top-left)       │      (top-right)      │\n│                       │                       │\n├───────────────────────┼───────────────────────┤\n│                       │                       │\n│   3. Console          │   4. Files / Plots /  │\n│      (bottom-left)    │      Help / Viewer    │\n│                       │      (bottom-right)   │\n└───────────────────────┴───────────────────────┘\n```\n\nLet's walk through each one.\n\n### 1. Source Editor (top-left)\n\nThis is your **main workspace** --- where you write and edit R scripts (`.R` files), Quarto documents (`.qmd` files), and other text files. Think of it as your notebook.\n\nKey things to know:\n\n- You can have **multiple files open** as tabs, just like browser tabs.\n- Code you write here is saved to a file --- this is how you keep your work **reproducible**.\n- To run a line of code, place your cursor on it and press **Cmd + Enter** (macOS) or **Ctrl + Enter** (Windows/Linux).\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Source vs Console\nYou *can* type code directly in the Console, but it won't be saved. To have a record of things you did, **write your code in the Source Editor** and run it from there.\n:::\n\n### 2. Environment (top-right)\n\nThe Environment pane shows **all the objects currently in your R session** --- variables, data frames, functions, and more. When you create something like:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- 42\n```\n:::\n\n\nyou'll see `x` appear here with a summary of their contents.\n\nThis pane also has tabs for:\n\n- **History** --- a log of every command you've run in the Console.\n- **Connections** --- for connecting to databases (not covered in this book).\n- **Tutorial** --- built-in interactive R tutorials from the `learnr` package.\n\n### 3. Console (bottom-left)\n\nThe Console is where R **actually runs your code** and displays output. When you press Cmd/Ctrl + Enter in the Source Editor, the code is sent here and executed.\n\nYou'll also see:\n\n- The R startup message when you first open RStudio.\n- Output from your code (printed results, messages, warnings).\n- Error messages when something goes wrong (we'll learn how to read these in a later chapter).\n\nThe `>` symbol is the **prompt** --- it means R is ready for your next command.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## The Terminal tab\nNext to the Console tab, you'll notice a **Terminal** tab. This gives you access to your system's command-line shell (Bash, Zsh, PowerShell, etc.). We won't use it much in this book, but it's useful for tasks like checking `quarto --version` or running Git commands.\n:::\n\n### 4. Files / Plots / Help (bottom-right)\n\nThis is a **multi-purpose pane** with several important tabs:\n\n- **Files** --- a file browser for your project folder. You can navigate, create, rename, and delete files here.\n- **Plots** --- where your graphs appear when you create them with `ggplot2` or other plotting functions.\n- **Packages** --- shows installed R packages and lets you load or install them.\n- **Help** --- displays documentation. When you type `?mean` in the Console, the help page appears here.\n- **Viewer** --- for previewing HTML output, Shiny apps, and other interactive content.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Quick help lookup\nTo get help on any R function, type `?` followed by the function name in the Console:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n?mean\n?read_csv\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe documentation will appear in the Help tab with a description, arguments, and examples.\n:::\n\n## File Types in RStudio\n\nWhen you create a new file in RStudio via **File > New File**, you'll see a list of file types:\n\n![New file menu in RStudio --- we'll focus on the two highlighted options](../../images/rstudio/rstudio-filetypes.png){#fig-rstudio-filetypes width=\"40%\"}\n\nThere are many options, but for this book we only need two: **R Script** and **Quarto Document**.\n\n### R Script (`.R`)\n\nAn R Script is a **plain text file** containing only R code. Each line is a command that R can execute. This is the simplest way to write and save your code.\n\n```r\n# my_analysis.R\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\niris |> filter(Sepal.Length > 6) |> summary()\n```\n\nUse R Scripts when you want to write code quickly without any narrative text --- for example, a data cleaning pipeline or a utility script.\n\nTo create one: **File > New File > R Script** (or **Cmd + Shift + N** / **Ctrl + Shift + N**).\n\n### Quarto Document (`.qmd`)\n\nA Quarto Document lets you combine **text** and **code** in the same file --- this is called **literate programming**. Instead of writing code and then separately writing a report about it, you do both in one document. When you render the file, Quarto runs the code and weaves the output (tables, plots, numbers) directly into the final document.\n\nA `.qmd` file looks like this:\n\n````markdown\n---\ntitle: \"Iris Analysis\"\nformat: html\n---\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis report analyzes the classic iris flower dataset.\n\n```{{r}}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nglimpse(iris)\n```\n\n## Results\n\nThe mean sepal length is `{{r}} mean(iris$Sepal.Length)` cm.\n````\n\nThis single file produces a complete HTML report with formatted text, code, and output. We'll explore Quarto in depth in a later chapter.\n\nTo create one: **File > New File > Quarto Document...**\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Quarto vs R Markdown --- a brief history\nIf you've seen `.Rmd` files or heard of **R Markdown**, Quarto is its successor. R Markdown (introduced in 2014) pioneered literate programming in R, and it's still widely used. Quarto (introduced in 2022) builds on the same ideas but is **language-agnostic** --- it works with R, Python, Julia, and Observable JS.\n\nIf you encounter R Markdown files in the wild, don't worry --- the syntax is very similar. For new projects, we recommend Quarto.\n:::\n\n### Which should I use?\n\n| | R Script (`.R`) | Quarto Document (`.qmd`) |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Contains** | Code only | Code + text + output |\n| **Good for** | Quick scripts, utilities, data pipelines | Reports, analyses, presentations |\n| **Output** | None (just runs code) | HTML, PDF, Word, slides |\n\n: Comparison of R Script and Quarto Document {#tbl-file-types}\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Start with R Scripts\nFor the first several chapters, we'll use plain **R Scripts** to focus on learning R itself. Once you're comfortable with the language, we'll switch to **Quarto Documents** to create reproducible reports.\n:::\n\n## Running Code in RStudio\n\nThere are several ways to run R code. Here are the most common:\n\n| Action | Shortcut |\n|---|---|\n| Run current line / selection | **Cmd + Enter** (macOS) / **Ctrl + Enter** (Windows/Linux) |\n| Run entire script | **Cmd + Shift + Enter** / **Ctrl + Shift + Enter** |\n| Run from beginning to current line | **Cmd + Option + B** / **Ctrl + Alt + B** |\n| Insert code chunk (in `.qmd` files) | **Cmd + Option + I** / **Ctrl + Alt + I** |\n\n: Commonly used keyboard shortcuts in RStudio {#tbl-rstudio-shortcuts}\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## The most important shortcut\nIf you remember only one shortcut from this book, make it **Cmd + Enter** (or Ctrl + Enter). You'll use it hundreds of times.\n:::\n\n## Create an RStudio Project\n\nBefore we start coding, let's set up an organized workspace. An RStudio **Project** is a self-contained folder for your work. It automatically sets the **working directory**, so file paths just work.\n\n1. Open RStudio\n2. Go to **File > New Project...**\n3. Select **\"New Directory\"**\n4. Select **\"New Project\"**\n5. Enter a directory name (e.g., `r4medds-workshop`)\n6. Choose where to save it on your computer\n7. Click **\"Create Project\"**\n\n<!-- ![Create a new RStudio Project](../../images/rstudio/screenshot-new-project.png) -->\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Why use RStudio Projects?\nProjects set the **working directory** automatically. This means `read_csv(\"data/diabetes.csv\")` will find the file without needing the full path like `\"/Users/you/Documents/r4medds-workshop/data/diabetes.csv\"`.\n\nIt also means you can move the project folder to a different location or share it with someone else, and all the file paths still work.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## What is a \"working directory\"?\nThe working directory is the folder R looks in by default when you read or save files. With an RStudio Project, the working directory is automatically set to the project folder --- the one containing the `.Rproj` file. You can check your current working directory with:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngetwd()\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## Customizing RStudio\n\nRStudio is highly customizable. Here are two settings worth exploring early on.\n\n### Pane Layout\n\nYou can rearrange which tabs appear in which pane. Go to **Tools > Global Options > Pane Layout**:\n\n![Customize which tabs appear in each pane](../../images/rstudio/rstudio-settings-panes.png){#fig-rstudio-pane-layout width=\"80%\"}\n\nThe default layout works well for most people, but you can move things around to suit your workflow. For example, some people prefer having the Console on the top-right instead of the bottom-left.\n\n### Appearance\n\nYou can change the editor theme, font, and font size. Go to **Tools > Global Options > Appearance**:\n\n![Choose a theme and font that's comfortable for you](../../images/rstudio/rstudio-settings-appearance.png){#fig-rstudio-appearance width=\"60%\"}\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Try a dark theme\nIf you'll be spending long hours coding, a dark theme (like \"Tomorrow Night\" or \"Dracula\") can reduce eye strain. Pick whatever feels comfortable --- you can always change it later.\n:::\n\n## Summary\n\nYou've now had a tour of RStudio's key features:\n\n- The **four panes**: Source Editor, Console, Environment, and Files/Plots/Help\n- How to **run code** with Cmd/Ctrl + Enter\n- How to create an **RStudio Project** for organized work\n- How to **customize** the layout and appearance\n\nWith your environment set up and your way around RStudio, you're ready to start learning R.
