This book is a practical, hands-on guide to learning R for data analysis --- written specifically for healthcare professionals.\n\nWhether you're a doctor wanting to analyze your research data, a nurse exploring patient outcomes, or a medical student curious about data science, this book will take you from zero programming experience to confidently working with clinical datasets in R.\n\n## Who This Book Is For\n\nThis book is for **healthcare professionals** who want to learn data analysis with R. You might be:\n\n- A physician who wants to move beyond Excel for research data\n- A medical resident preparing to analyze data for a thesis\n- A nurse or allied health professional exploring patient outcomes\n- A researcher who wants reproducible, transparent analysis workflows\n\n**No prior programming experience is assumed.** If you can use a spreadsheet, you can learn R. Some familiarity with data (rows, columns, variables) is helpful but not required --- we'll cover everything from scratch.\n\nThis book originated as material for a 1-day onsite workshop, but it is designed as a **standalone, self-paced resource**. You can work through it at your own speed, revisiting chapters as needed.\n\n## What You Will Learn\n\nThis book covers the essential skills for data analysis with R:\n\n- **R programming fundamentals** --- variables, data types, vectors, functions, and pipes\n- **Data wrangling** --- importing, cleaning, filtering, and transforming data with the Tidyverse\n- **Data visualization** --- creating publication-quality plots with ggplot2\n- **Basic statistics** --- descriptive statistics, hypothesis tests, and publication-ready tables\n- **Reproducible reports** --- combining code, text, and output with Quarto\n- **LLM integration** --- using Large Language Models from R to augment your data workflows\n\n> By the end of this book, you will be able to import a clinical dataset, clean it, create publication-quality tables and figures, run basic statistical tests, and generate a reproducible report --- all in R.\n\n## How This Book Is Organized\n\nThe book is organized into three main parts, preceded by a setup guide and a motivation chapter:\n\n- **Chapter 0: Setup & Installation** --- get your R environment ready\n- **Chapter 1: Why R?** --- motivation for learning R as a healthcare professional\n\n**Part 1: R Programming (Chapters 2--3)**\n:   The foundations --- data types, vectors, functions, pipes, data frames, and tibbles.\n\n**Part 2: Data Analysis with Tidyverse (Chapters 4--8)**\n:   The core skills --- importing data, wrangling with dplyr, tidying with tidyr, visualization with ggplot2, and basic statistics with gtsummary.\n\n**Part 3: Beyond the Basics (Chapters 9--11)**\n:   Reproducible reports with Quarto, using LLMs from R, and a roadmap for continued learning.\n\nThe chapters are designed to be read **sequentially**, as each builds on the previous. After your first read-through, the book can serve as a reference you return to for specific topics.\n\n## About the Author\n\nI'm a diagnostic radiologist working in a specialized AI unit in the radiology department. R was my first programming language --- I started learning it about five years ago while working as an assistant professor in a Physiology department, motivated by wanting a coding skill that could be applied directly in the medical domain.\n\nI built my foundation through two excellent books: *Hands-On Programming with R* and *R for Data Science*. Exploring the Tidyverse ecosystem taught me not just how to code, but how to *think about data*. The Tidyverse's design philosophy --- clear, composable functions that read like English --- remains one of the best-designed data science frameworks I've encountered.\n\nOver the years, I've used R for research and non-research data analysis, machine learning (with Tidymodels), building websites and blogs (Shiny, Quarto), and creating R packages. I then transitioned through a Diagnostic Radiology residency program and expanded into Python, Flutter, and C# --- becoming more of a software engineer along the way.\n\nMy vision for this book is to share what I've learned and inspire other healthcare professionals to discover the power of programming for their work.\n\n## Conventions Used in This Book\n\n### Code Blocks\n\nThroughout this book, R code is shown in gray boxes. The output appears directly below:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1 + 1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 2\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhen you see a code block like this, try running it yourself in RStudio to build your intuition.\n\n### Callout Blocks\n\nWe use four types of callout blocks to highlight important information:\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Tip\nTips highlight best practices, useful shortcuts, and advice that will save you time.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Note\nNotes provide additional context, background information, or interesting details.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n## Warning\nWarnings flag common mistakes and pitfalls to avoid.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\" title=\"Python Comparison\"}\nSome chapters include optional **Python comparison** callouts like this one. They are **collapsible** --- click to expand. These show the equivalent Python syntax side-by-side with R, for readers who are curious or come from a Python background.\n\nFor example, to create a variable:\n\n- **R:** `x <- 42`\n- **Python:** `x = 42`\n\nYou can safely skip these callouts if you're not interested in Python.\n:::\n\n### Exercises\n\nMost chapters end with exercises to practice what you've learned. Solutions are provided in Appendix C. We encourage you to attempt the exercises before checking the solutions!\n\n### Datasets\n\nAll datasets used in this book are either loaded from R packages or bundled as CSV files in the `data/` folder. You don't need to download anything separately.\n\n## Recommended References {.unnumbered}\n\nThis book is self-contained, but if you want to go deeper, these are excellent resources:\n\n- [**Hands-On Programming with R**](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/) by Garrett Grolemund --- beginner-friendly; learn R by building projects.\n- [**R for Data Science (2e)**](https://r4ds.hadley.nz) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund --- the classic Tidyverse reference.\n- [**Reproducible Medical Research with R**](https://bookdown.org/pdr_higgins/rmrwr/) by Peter Higgins --- a medical-focused R book.\n",
