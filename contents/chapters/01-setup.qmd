# Setup & Installation {.unnumbered}

Before diving into R, let's set up your development environment. By the end of this chapter, you'll have **R**, **RStudio**, and **Quarto** installed and ready to go.

If you run into any difficulties with installation, see @sec-posit-cloud for a browser-based alternative that requires no installation.

## Install R

R is the programming language we'll use throughout this book. 

Please go to the CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) website to download R: 

<https://cloud.r-project.org/>

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Windows

1. Click **"Download R for Windows"**
2. Click **"base"**
3. Click the download link for the latest version (e.g., "Download R-4.x.x for Windows")
4. Run the installer with default settings

### macOS

1. Click **"Download R for macOS"**
2. Choose the correct installer for your Mac:
   - **Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4):** download the `arm64` version
   - **Intel Mac:** download the `x86_64` version
3. Open the `.pkg` file and follow the installer

### Linux

1. Click **"Download R for Linux"**
2. Follow the instructions for your distribution (Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, etc.)

:::

::: {.callout-note}
## Which version of R?
As of this writing, R 4.x is the current major version.
:::

## Install RStudio Desktop

RStudio is an **integrated development environment (IDE)** for R --- it's where you'll write and run your R code. Take car analogy as en example: **R** is the *engine*, and **RStudio** is the *dashboard*.

Download RStudio Desktop (free) from:

<https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>

1. Go to the link above
2. Download the **RStudio Desktop** installer for your operating system
3. Run the installer with default settings
4. Open RStudio --- it should automatically detect your R installation

![RStudio download page](../../images/install/download-r-studio.png){#fig-download-r-studio width="60%"}

::: {.callout-warning}
## Install R first, then RStudio
RStudio needs R to work. Always install R (the previous step) before installing RStudio.
:::

## Install Quarto CLI (Optional)

Quarto is a publishing system that lets you create reports, documents, presentations, and websites from R code and text. We'll use Quarto in @sec-quarto to create reproducible reports.
<!-- TODO: confirm @sec-quarto cross-ref label once Ch 9 is created -->

Download Quarto from:

<https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/>

1. Go to the link above
2. Download the Quarto CLI installer for your operating system
3. Run the installer with default settings

::: {.callout-note}
## Quarto may already be bundled with RStudio
Recent versions of RStudio (2022.07+) include Quarto. You may already have it. To check, open a terminal and run:

```{bash}
#| eval: false
quarto --version
```

We still recommend installing the latest Quarto CLI separately to ensure you have the newest features.
:::

## Install Required R Packages

R packages are **add-ons** that give R new abilities --- think of them as apps for your phone. We'll use several packages throughout this book.

Open RStudio and copy the following code in the **Console** pane (bottom-left), then hit "Enter":

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

Example Screenshot:

![Install `tidyverse` R package](../../images/install/install-pkg-tidyverse.png){#fig-install-pkg-tidyverse width="100%"}

::: {.callout-tip}
## This may take a few minutes
Package installation downloads files from the internet and compiles code. Be patient --- this is a one-time process. You may see lots of messages scrolling by; that's normal.
:::

::: {.callout-warning}
## Errors during installation?
If you see an error about a package not being available, check your internet connection and try again. If a specific package fails, you can skip it for now and install it later when the relevant chapter requires it.
:::

## Verify Your Installation

Let's run a quick test to confirm everything is working. Create a new R script in RStudio (**File > New File > R Script**) and run the following code:

```{r}
#| eval: false

# Test 1: R is working
print("Hello, R!")

# Test 2: Tidyverse loads successfully
library(tidyverse)
```

Expected Output:

```
> # Test 1: R is working
> print("Hello, R!")
[1] "Hello, R!"

> # Test 2: Tidyverse loads successfully
> library(tidyverse)
```

If you see the following output in the Console (see @sec-rstudio-panes) with no erors, your setup is complete!

::: {.callout-tip}
## How to run code in RStudio
Place your cursor on a line of code and press **Cmd + Enter** (macOS) or **Ctrl + Enter** (Windows/Linux) to run it. You can also select multiple lines and run them all at once.
:::

## Posit Cloud (Online Alternative) {#sec-posit-cloud}

If you encounter installation difficulties or want to get started immediately without installing anything, you can use **Posit Cloud** --- a browser-based version of RStudio.

1. Go to <https://posit.cloud/>
2. Create a free account
3. Click **"New Project"** > **"New RStudio Project"**
4. You'll get a full RStudio environment in your browser

<!-- ![Posit Cloud](../../images/screenshot-posit-cloud.png) -->

::: {.callout-note}
Posit Cloud is great for getting started quickly, but the free tier has limited computing hours per month. We recommend installing R and RStudio on your computer for long-term use.
:::

## Summary

You now have a complete R development environment:

- [x] **R** --- the programming language
- [x] **RStudio** --- the IDE where you write and run code
- [x] **Quarto** (Optional) --- the tool for creating reproducible reports
- [x] **R packages** --- the add-ons we'll use throughout this book

In the next chapter, we'll take a guided tour of RStudio so you know your way around before we start coding.
