# A Tour of RStudio {.unnumbered}

Now that you have R and RStudio installed, let's get familiar with the tool you'll be using. RStudio is an **integrated development environment (IDE)** --- think of it as the cockpit where you'll write code, view results, manage files, and explore data, all in one place.

## The Four Panes {#sec-rstudio-panes}

When you first open RStudio, you'll see the interface divided into four main panes:

![The RStudio IDE with four panes labeled](../../images/rstudio/rstudio-panes.png){#fig-rstudio-panes width="100%"}

```
┌───────────────────────┬───────────────────────┐
│                       │                       │

├───────────────────────┼───────────────────────┤
│                       │                       │

│                       │      (bottom-right)   │
└───────────────────────┴───────────────────────┘
```

Let's walk through each one.

### 1. Source Editor (top-left)

This is your **main workspace** --- where you write and edit R scripts (`.R` files), Quarto documents (`.qmd` files), and other text files. Think of it as your notebook.

Key things to know:

- You can have **multiple files open** as tabs, just like browser tabs.
- Code you write here is saved to a file --- this is how you keep your work **reproducible**.
- To run a line of code, place your cursor on it and press **Cmd + Enter** (macOS) or **Ctrl + Enter** (Windows/Linux).

::: {.callout-tip}
## Source vs Console
You *can* type code directly in the Console, but it won't be saved. To have a record of things you did, **write your code in the Source Editor** and run it from there.
:::

### 2. Environment (top-right)

The Environment pane shows **all the objects currently in your R session** --- variables, data frames, functions, and more. When you create something like:

```{r}
#| eval: false
x <- 42
```

you'll see `x` appear here with a summary of their contents.

This pane also has tabs for:

- **History** --- a log of every command you've run in the Console.
- **Connections** --- for connecting to databases (not covered in this book).
- **Tutorial** --- built-in interactive R tutorials from the `learnr` package.

### 3. Console (bottom-left)

The Console is where R **actually runs your code** and displays output. When you press Cmd/Ctrl + Enter in the Source Editor, the code is sent here and executed.

You'll also see:

- The R startup message when you first open RStudio.
- Output from your code (printed results, messages, warnings).
- Error messages when something goes wrong (we'll learn how to read these in a later chapter).

The `>` symbol is the **prompt** --- it means R is ready for your next command.

::: {.callout-note}
## The Terminal tab
Next to the Console tab, you'll notice a **Terminal** tab. This gives you access to your system's command-line shell (Bash, Zsh, PowerShell, etc.). We won't use it much in this book, but it's useful for tasks like checking `quarto --version` or running Git commands.
:::

### 4. Files / Plots / Help (bottom-right)

This is a **multi-purpose pane** with several important tabs:

- **Files** --- a file browser for your project folder. You can navigate, create, rename, and delete files here.
- **Plots** --- where your graphs appear when you create them with `ggplot2` or other plotting functions.
- **Packages** --- shows installed R packages and lets you load or install them.
- **Help** --- displays documentation. When you type `?mean` in the Console, the help page appears here.
- **Viewer** --- for previewing HTML output, Shiny apps, and other interactive content.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Quick help lookup
To get help on any R function, type `?` followed by the function name in the Console:

```{r}
#| eval: false
?mean
?read_csv
```

The documentation will appear in the Help tab with a description, arguments, and examples.
:::

## File Types in RStudio

When you create a new file in RStudio via **File > New File**, you'll see a list of file types:

![New file menu in RStudio --- we'll focus on the two highlighted options](../../images/rstudio/rstudio-filetypes.png){#fig-rstudio-filetypes width="40%"}

There are many options, but for this book we only need two: **R Script** and **Quarto Document**.

### R Script (`.R`)

An R Script is a **plain text file** containing only R code. Each line is a command that R can execute. This is the simplest way to write and save your code.

```r
# my_analysis.R
library(tidyverse)

iris |> filter(Sepal.Length > 6) |> summary()
```

Use R Scripts when you want to write code quickly without any narrative text --- for example, a data cleaning pipeline or a utility script.

To create one: **File > New File > R Script** (or **Cmd + Shift + N** / **Ctrl + Shift + N**).

### Quarto Document (`.qmd`)

A Quarto Document lets you combine **text** and **code** in the same file --- this is called **literate programming**. Instead of writing code and then separately writing a report about it, you do both in one document. When you render the file, Quarto runs the code and weaves the output (tables, plots, numbers) directly into the final document.

A `.qmd` file looks like this:

````markdown
---
title: "Iris Analysis"
format: html
---

## Introduction

This report analyzes the classic iris flower dataset.

```{{r}}
library(tidyverse)
glimpse(iris)
```

## Results

The mean sepal length is `{{r}} mean(iris$Sepal.Length)` cm.
````

This single file produces a complete HTML report with formatted text, code, and output. We'll explore Quarto in depth in a later chapter.

To create one: **File > New File > Quarto Document...**

::: {.callout-note}
## Quarto vs R Markdown --- a brief history
If you've seen `.Rmd` files or heard of **R Markdown**, Quarto is its successor. R Markdown (introduced in 2014) pioneered literate programming in R, and it's still widely used. Quarto (introduced in 2022) builds on the same ideas but is **language-agnostic** --- it works with R, Python, Julia, and Observable JS.

If you encounter R Markdown files in the wild, don't worry --- the syntax is very similar. For new projects, we recommend Quarto.
:::

### Which should I use?

| | R Script (`.R`) | Quarto Document (`.qmd`) |
|---|---|---|
| **Contains** | Code only | Code + text + output |
| **Good for** | Quick scripts, utilities, data pipelines | Reports, analyses, presentations |
| **Output** | None (just runs code) | HTML, PDF, Word, slides |

: Comparison of R Script and Quarto Document {#tbl-file-types}

::: {.callout-tip}
## Start with R Scripts
For the first several chapters, we'll use plain **R Scripts** to focus on learning R itself. Once you're comfortable with the language, we'll switch to **Quarto Documents** to create reproducible reports.
:::

## Running Code in RStudio

There are several ways to run R code. Here are the most common:

| Action | Shortcut |
|---|---|
| Run current line / selection | **Cmd + Enter** (macOS) / **Ctrl + Enter** (Windows/Linux) |
| Run entire script | **Cmd + Shift + Enter** / **Ctrl + Shift + Enter** |
| Run from beginning to current line | **Cmd + Option + B** / **Ctrl + Alt + B** |
| Insert code chunk (in `.qmd` files) | **Cmd + Option + I** / **Ctrl + Alt + I** |

: Commonly used keyboard shortcuts in RStudio {#tbl-rstudio-shortcuts}

::: {.callout-tip}
## The most important shortcut
If you remember only one shortcut from this book, make it **Cmd + Enter** (or Ctrl + Enter). You'll use it hundreds of times.
:::

## Create an RStudio Project

Before we start coding, let's set up an organized workspace. An RStudio **Project** is a self-contained folder for your work. It automatically sets the **working directory**, so file paths just work.

1. Open RStudio
2. Go to **File > New Project...**
3. Select **"New Directory"**
4. Select **"New Project"**
5. Enter a directory name (e.g., `r4medds-workshop`)
6. Choose where to save it on your computer
7. Click **"Create Project"**

<!-- ![Create a new RStudio Project](../../images/rstudio/screenshot-new-project.png) -->

::: {.callout-tip}
## Why use RStudio Projects?
Projects set the **working directory** automatically. This means `read_csv("data/diabetes.csv")` will find the file without needing the full path like `"/Users/you/Documents/r4medds-workshop/data/diabetes.csv"`.

It also means you can move the project folder to a different location or share it with someone else, and all the file paths still work.
:::

::: {.callout-note}
## What is a "working directory"?
The working directory is the folder R looks in by default when you read or save files. With an RStudio Project, the working directory is automatically set to the project folder --- the one containing the `.Rproj` file. You can check your current working directory with:

```{r}
#| eval: false
getwd()
```
:::

## Customizing RStudio

RStudio is highly customizable. Here are two settings worth exploring early on.

### Pane Layout

You can rearrange which tabs appear in which pane. Go to **Tools > Global Options > Pane Layout**:

![Customize which tabs appear in each pane](../../images/rstudio/rstudio-settings-panes.png){#fig-rstudio-pane-layout width="80%"}

The default layout works well for most people, but you can move things around to suit your workflow. For example, some people prefer having the Console on the top-right instead of the bottom-left.

### Appearance

You can change the editor theme, font, and font size. Go to **Tools > Global Options > Appearance**:

![Choose a theme and font that's comfortable for you](../../images/rstudio/rstudio-settings-appearance.png){#fig-rstudio-appearance width="60%"}

::: {.callout-tip}
## Try a dark theme
If you'll be spending long hours coding, a dark theme (like "Tomorrow Night" or "Dracula") can reduce eye strain. Pick whatever feels comfortable --- you can always change it later.
:::
