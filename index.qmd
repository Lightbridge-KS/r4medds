# Preface {.unnumbered}

Welcome to *R for Medical Data Analysis*. This book is a practical, hands-on guide to learning R for data analysis --- written specifically for healthcare professionals.

Whether you're a doctor wanting to analyze your research data, a nurse exploring patient outcomes, or a medical student curious about data science, this book will take you from zero programming experience to confidently working with clinical datasets in R.

## Who This Book Is For

This book is for **healthcare professionals** who want to learn data analysis with R. You might be:

- A physician who wants to move beyond Excel for research data
- A medical resident preparing to analyze data for a thesis
- A nurse or allied health professional exploring patient outcomes
- A researcher who wants reproducible, transparent analysis workflows

**No prior programming experience is assumed.** If you can use a spreadsheet, you can learn R. Some familiarity with data (rows, columns, variables) is helpful but not required --- we'll cover everything from scratch.

This book originated as material for a 1-day onsite workshop, but it is designed as a **standalone, self-paced resource**. You can work through it at your own speed, revisiting chapters as needed.

## What You Will Learn

This book covers the essential skills for data analysis with R:

- **R programming fundamentals** --- variables, data types, vectors, functions, and pipes
- **Data wrangling** --- importing, cleaning, filtering, and transforming data with the Tidyverse
- **Data visualization** --- creating publication-quality plots with ggplot2
- **Basic statistics** --- descriptive statistics, hypothesis tests, and publication-ready tables
- **Reproducible reports** --- combining code, text, and output with Quarto
- **LLM integration** --- using Large Language Models from R to augment your data workflows

> By the end of this book, you will be able to import a clinical dataset, clean it, create publication-quality tables and figures, run basic statistical tests, and generate a reproducible report --- all in R.

## How This Book Is Organized

The book is organized into three main parts, preceded by a setup guide and a motivation chapter:

- **Chapter 0: Setup & Installation** --- get your R environment ready
- **Chapter 1: Why R?** --- motivation for learning R as a healthcare professional

**Part 1: R Programming (Chapters 2--3)**
:   The foundations --- data types, vectors, functions, pipes, data frames, and tibbles.

**Part 2: Data Analysis with Tidyverse (Chapters 4--8)**
:   The core skills --- importing data, wrangling with dplyr, tidying with tidyr, visualization with ggplot2, and basic statistics with gtsummary.

**Part 3: Beyond the Basics (Chapters 9--11)**
:   Reproducible reports with Quarto, using LLMs from R, and a roadmap for continued learning.

The chapters are designed to be read **sequentially**, as each builds on the previous. After your first read-through, the book can serve as a reference you return to for specific topics.

## About the Author

I'm a diagnostic radiologist working in a specialized AI unit in the radiology department. R was my first programming language --- I started learning it about five years ago while working as an assistant professor in a Physiology department, motivated by wanting a coding skill that could be applied directly in the medical domain.

I built my foundation through two excellent books: *Hands-On Programming with R* and *R for Data Science*. Exploring the Tidyverse ecosystem taught me not just how to code, but how to *think about data*. The Tidyverse's design philosophy --- clear, composable functions that read like English --- remains one of the best-designed data science frameworks I've encountered.

Over the years, I've used R for research and non-research data analysis, machine learning (with Tidymodels), building websites and blogs (Shiny, Quarto), and creating R packages. I then transitioned through a Diagnostic Radiology residency program and expanded into Python, Flutter, and C# --- becoming more of a software engineer along the way.

My vision for this book is to share what I've learned and inspire other healthcare professionals to discover the power of programming for their work.

## Conventions Used in This Book

### Code Blocks

Throughout this book, R code is shown in gray boxes. The output appears directly below:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

When you see a code block like this, try running it yourself in RStudio to build your intuition.

### Callout Blocks

We use four types of callout blocks to highlight important information:

::: {.callout-tip}
## Tip
Tips highlight best practices, useful shortcuts, and advice that will save you time.
:::

::: {.callout-note}
## Note
Notes provide additional context, background information, or interesting details.
:::

::: {.callout-warning}
## Warning
Warnings flag common mistakes and pitfalls to avoid.
:::

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true" title="Python Comparison"}
Some chapters include optional **Python comparison** callouts like this one. They are **collapsible** --- click to expand. These show the equivalent Python syntax side-by-side with R, for readers who are curious or come from a Python background.

For example, to create a variable:

- **R:** `x <- 42`
- **Python:** `x = 42`

You can safely skip these callouts if you're not interested in Python.

### Exercises

Most chapters end with exercises to practice what you've learned. Solutions are provided in Appendix C. We encourage you to attempt the exercises before checking the solutions!

### Datasets

All datasets used in this book are either loaded from R packages or bundled as CSV files in the `data/` folder. You don't need to download anything separately.
